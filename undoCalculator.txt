BINARY OPERATIONS (a b) -> b is the last number entered
+   adds a and b
-   subtracts a from b
*   multiplies a and b
/   divides b over a 
%   a modulus b 
**  b to the power of a 
//  b integer division a 
gcd greatest common denominator of a and b 
lcm lowest common multiple of a and b 
|   performs OR operation on the bits of a and b => converts back to decimal
&   performs AND operation on the bits of a and b => converts back to decimal 
^   performs XOR operation on the bits of a and b => converts back to decimal
